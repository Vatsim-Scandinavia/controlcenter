## All versions

Updating between minor versions only requires you to run migration and clear caches.
Remember to [run the theme build](setup/theme.md) again if you have a custom theme.

Once done, you must migrate the database changes and clear the cache:

```sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan optimize:clear
```

## Upgrading to v5.1.0

Please follow these steps if you wish to use the new VATEUD Core integration. May be skipped otherwise.

- Make sure you've configured all your T1/T2 endorsements in [rating table](setup/division.md#ratings).
- Manually sync any existing solos, mentors and examiners in Core prior to enabling the integration.
- Update your environment file with the new variables found in the example file.
- This will be run daily by the scheduler, but run this manually first time:
    - Run the artisan command `php artisan sync:roster` to sync the roster.
    - Run the artisan command `php artisan sync:endorsements <your cid>` to add existing T1/T2 endorsements.
