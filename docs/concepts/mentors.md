# Mentors

*Mentors* are active ATC members in the vACC who help teach division members and visiting controllers the necessary syllabus, theoretical and practical, relevant to the vACC and rating [they have applied for][training].

## Mentees

There are no limitations to the number of active trainings a mentor can have. There's however a hard limit of having a mentor assigned 12 months before they will automatically be removed. This is to avoid mentors having access to personal data over long time, and most trainings are assumed to be finished within this.
