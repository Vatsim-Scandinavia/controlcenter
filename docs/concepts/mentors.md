# Mentors

*Mentors* are active ATC members in the vACC who help teach division members and visiting controllers the necessary syllabus, theoretical and practical, relevant to the vACC and rating [they have applied for][training].

## Mentees

Depending on workload and local vACC processes, mentors will pick up [training requests from other division members][training]. There are no limitations to the number of active trainings a mentor can have.

<!-- TODO: cheeky tip that maybe doesn't belong here -->

!!! tip "Reasonable limits"
    As a rule of thumb, the lower the rating, the more controllers you can teach in parallel.
    Training pools for S1 ratings are much more common than training pools for S3 ratings or above.

    While every training director or vACC's decide for themselves how many trainings a mentor can have in parallel, we normally recommend keeping the number of mentees in progress as close to one-to-one as feasible.
