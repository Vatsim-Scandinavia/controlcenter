Handling training requests and keeping a VATSIM Area Control Centre (or multiple!) active takes a lot of work.
Control Center is built on the idea of reducing the amount of work, while also making the experience faster and enjoyable.

- Handle training flow of virtual Air Traffic Controllers (ATC)
- Set and maintain custom activity targets for ATCs, and mark ATCs that fall under the target as inactive
- Clean up members, trainings and exams in the event of account closure
- GDPR compliant
