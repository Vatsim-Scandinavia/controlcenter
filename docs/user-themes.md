## Theme Options Explained

### 🌞 Light Theme
Perfect for well-lit environments:
- Bright, clean appearance
- Dark text on light backgrounds
- Traditional color scheme
- Easy to read in daylight

**Best for:**
- Office environments
- Daytime use
- High-brightness displays
- Shared screens

### 🌙 Dark Theme
Optimized for low-light conditions:
- Dark backgrounds throughout
- Light text for reduced eye strain
- Gentle on the eyes
- Modern appearance

**Best for:**
- Evening use
- Dimly lit rooms
- OLED/AMOLED screens (saves battery)
- Extended reading sessions
- Reducing blue light exposure

### 🖥️ System Default
The smart choice:
- Follows your operating system's theme
- Automatically switches between light and dark
- No manual switching needed
- Respects your system-wide preferences

**Best for:**
- Users who change themes throughout the day
- Consistency with other applications
- Automatic day/night switching
- Modern operating system integration

## How System Theme Works

When you select "System Default", Control Center automatically detects your device's theme preference:

### macOS
- Follows **System Preferences > General > Appearance**
- Auto-switches with "Auto" mode based on time of day

### Windows
- Follows **Settings > Personalization > Colors > Choose your color**
- Can be set to light, dark, or automatic

### Linux
- Follows your desktop environment's theme setting
- Varies by DE (GNOME, KDE, etc.)

### The Smart Part
When your system theme changes (e.g., at sunset), Control Center automatically switches too - no page reload needed!

## Features

### Instant Switching
Themes change immediately when you select them. No need to refresh the page or log out.

### Remembers Your Choice
Your theme preference is saved and will be the same:
- On different pages
- After logging out and back in
- On different devices (once you save on each)
- Across browser sessions

### No Flash
When you load a page, the correct theme applies instantly. You won't see a "flash" of the wrong theme.

### Works Everywhere
Every part of the application respects your theme:
- Navigation and menus
- Forms and inputs
- Tables and lists
- Pop-up windows
- Notifications
- Text editors
- Charts and graphs

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Theme Testing
Want to try different themes?
1. Change your theme in settings
2. Browse around the application
3. If you don't like it, come back and change it again
4. Your preference saves automatically when you click Save

### Battery Saving (OLED Screens)
If you have an OLED display (many modern phones, tablets, and laptops):
- Dark theme can significantly save battery life
- Black pixels on OLED are actually "off"
- Consider using dark theme when on battery power

### Eye Strain Reduction
If you experience eye strain:
- Try dark theme in low-light environments
- Use light theme in bright environments
- Let system theme switch automatically
- Consider taking regular breaks regardless of theme

### Accessibility
Both themes meet WCAG accessibility standards:
- Sufficient contrast ratios for all text
- Clear visual indicators for interactive elements
- Color is not the only means of conveying information

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will my theme choice affect other users?
**A:** No, each user has their own theme preference. Your choice only affects what you see.

### Q: Does the theme change affect mobile?
**A:** Yes! Your theme preference works on all devices once you're logged in.

### Q: Can I schedule theme changes?
**A:** Use "System Default" - most operating systems can schedule light/dark mode based on time of day.

### Q: What if I don't see the theme option?
**A:** Contact your administrator. The theme system may need to be enabled or updated.

### Q: Does dark theme save data/bandwidth?
**A:** No, themes only change how the page looks. The data transferred is the same.

### Q: Can I customize the colors?
**A:** Individual users cannot customize colors, but administrators can. See the [administrator documentation](setup/theme.md).

### Q: Which theme is better?
**A:** It's personal preference! We recommend:
   - **Light** during the day
   - **Dark** in the evening
   - **System** to switch automatically

### Q: Why does my theme reset sometimes?
**A:** This shouldn't happen. If it does:
   1. Make sure you clicked "Save" after selecting your theme
   2. Check that your browser isn't blocking cookies/storage
   3. Contact your administrator if the problem persists

## Technical Notes

Modern browsers support theme switching:
- Chrome/Edge (version 88+)

Older browsers will display the light theme only.

- Can be changed at any time
